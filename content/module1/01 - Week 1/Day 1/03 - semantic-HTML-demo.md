# 02- Semantic HTML





### [MDN Semantic elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Semantics#Semantic_elements)



Semantic HTML or semantic markup is HTML that introduces meaning to the web page rather than just presentation. 



A semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer.



For example, a <p> tag meaning is that the enclosed text is a paragraph.



###### Semantic elements = elements with a meaning.



###### A semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer.



##### Examples of non-semantic elements:   ` <div>` and `<span>` - Tells nothing about its content.

##### Examples of semantic elements: `<form>`, `<table>`, and `<article>` - Clearly defines its content.







### Example of tag `<b></b>` and `<strong></strong>`



Tag `<b>` only makes the text bold, while `<strong>` gives it the meaning that it is important. For example think of a screen reader or a person with impaired vision that is listening to the content. That is how the screen reader know what to emphasize as an important content, for example `<em>` tag instead of `<i>`

## HTML Accessibility



Accessibility starts with using semantic elements.



### Accessibility Attributes for html tags/elements



## Alternative Text - alt

**The `alt` attribute provides an alternate text for an image,** if the user for some reason cannot view it (because of slow connection, an error in the src attribute, or if the user uses a screen reader).

```html
<img src="img_chania.jpg" alt="Flowers in Chania">
```



## Declare the Language - `lang`

Declaring a language is important for screen readers and search engines. Use `lang` attribute.

```html
<html lang="en">
```



## Link Titles

The `title` attribute specifies extra information about an element. 

```html
<a href="https://www.google.com/" title="Click link to visit Google.com">Google</a>
```
