Semantic HTML or semantic markup is HTML that introduces meaning to the web page rather than just presentation. For example, a <p> tag indicates that the enclosed text is a paragraph.

Semantics is the study of the meanings of words and phrases in a language.

Semantic elements = elements with a meaning.

A semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer.

Examples of non-semantic elements: <div> and <span> - Tells nothing about its content.

Examples of semantic elements: <form>, <table>, and <article> - Clearly defines its content.

Section and header can contain each other, usually confusion which to put first.

The <header> element specifies a header for a document or section.
