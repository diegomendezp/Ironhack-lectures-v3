### Create a folder structure

```bash
mkdir 04-js-intro

cd 04-js-intro

vanilla-js

code .
```

**or**

```bash
mkdir 04-js-intro

cd 04-js-intro

mkdir images scripts styles

touch index.html scripts/index.js

code .
```











#### 1. Create `index.html` skeleton

#### 2. Load the `index.js` via the `<script></script>` tag

#### 3. Go Live ->  and open the Chrome Dev console






## What is JavaScript?

**JavaScript is a lightweight compiled, dynamically typed programming language with first-class functions**.



- **compiled programming language** - the JavaScript engine actually *compiles* the program to the machine language on the fly and then immediately runs the compiled code.

  

- **Dynamically-Typed language:** No need to declare the data type of the variable, it is determined during the run-time.

  

  

  ~~**Advanced**~~

  ~~JS is not interpreted, it is compiled.~~

  ~~<u>Interpreted language is being saved same as it is written no translating</u>, and is <u>translated line by line on runtime</u>. - faster in development but not as fast as compiled language.~~







### JavaScript Environments



- JavaScript was <u>created to run in the browser</u>  (mostly used for the Web) 

- around 10 years ago it became possible to use it in <u> non-browser environments:</u> 
  - #### [Node.js (server side)](https://nodejs.org/en/) - created 2009 (by Ryan Dahl)
  
    - In 2018 node surpassed 1 billion downlads
  
  - #### [Electron](https://electronjs.org/) - Environment used for building desktop applications 





#### 





### [ECMAScript](https://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-262.htm)

 - **ECMAScript** is the language implementation standard for JavaScript.

   

   ##### Evolving **language** - Until now JavaScript went through a lot of updates and changes.

   

   The versions of ECMAScript (shorter *ES*) that are still in use are :

   \- **ES5** (2009.)

   \- **ES6** (2015.)

   \- **ES7** (2016.)

   \- **ES8** ( 2017.)

   \- **ES9** ( 2018.)

   \- **ES10** ( 2019.)

   \- **ES2020** aka ES11 (2020.)

   
   
   **Each version of ECMAScript introduces new features to the language**, while keeping the language backward-compatible.







Enough of theory,  let‚Äôs move to JavaScript and  start writing  code.







## Basic JavaScript Syntax

- The **syntax** of a programming language is the **set of rules** that needs to be respected by programmers.
- JavaScript syntax has quite a few **curly braces** `{ `and **parentheses** `()`. - (the only similarity to Java)
- **Parentheses ()** and **curly braces {}** **are mandatory** and will cause an error if they‚Äôre left out. 
- **JavaScript** does not strictly require **semicolons**, however we use them always to prevent [possible errors](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/codebyte-why-are-explicit-semicolons-important-in-javascript-49550bea0b82/).









#### Example of an Output in Javascript 



We will use a function called `console.log()` to create an output. 

`console.log()` is your friend  :smiley:



```js
console.log('Hello Ironhackers');
```



#### Comments

Writing comments in your code is important 



- easy to find stuff in the code
- gives structure for others when reading your code

```js
// a short, one-line comment
```

```js
/* 
this is a longer,
multi-line comment
*/
```





## Variables

### What is a variable?

#### Variable is a named container or a storage for data in the memory.



The purpose behind naming them is to be able to **reference** them later on.







#### *different values* can be stored in variables, known as **datatypes in JavaScript**:

-  string
- number
-  array
-  object,
-  boolean
-  etc....



```js
// Primitives
var myString = "Uros";
var myNumber = 100;
var myBoolean = true; // true or false
var myUndefined = undefined;
var myNull = null;

// Objects
var myObject = {};
var myArray = [];


// We won't use the below data types
var mySymbol = Symbol();
var myBigInt = 9007199254740991n; 
// A BigInt is created by appending `n` to the end of an integer literal 

```





### Declaring and Initializing a variable

Before you can use a variable in a JavaScript, you have to **declare** it. 



Declaring simply means ‚Äúsaving a spot in a memory‚Äù without assigning any value to it. 



To **declare or define** a variable we can use keyword **let** or **const**.

in older versions of JavaScript, you will find keyword **var** which is used to declare variables. 



`var` is still used and there are few differences between **var**, **let** and **const** . 

**We will go over this differences a bit later.** 





#### VARIABLE DECLARATION with `var`

```js
// Creating a variable - variable declaration

var user;
```

```js
// Declaring multiple variables on one line
var age, email, address;
```



### variable initialization

After we declare a variable, we store some value in it. 

This is called **variable initialization.**

```js
// Assigning a value to a variable  =

user = 'John';  // variable initialization - putting a value inside
age = 30;  // variable initialization
```





### variable initialization and declaration

#### We can make variable initialization at the time of variable creation.

```js
// variable declaration and assignment
var city = 'Barcelona';
```







#### Naming a variable



Rules for naming variables:

1. Names **can contain letters** (uppercase and lowercase), **numbers** and the symbols `_`and `$`.
2. **The first character of the name can‚Äôt be a number.**





```js
// Naming a variable:
// - Names can contain letters, numbers and the symbols `_` and `$`
// - First character can't be number
// - JS is case sensitive

var a;
var color;

var _private; // convention - common practice (private variable)
var HOURS;// convention - common practice (constant variables)
var $button;

var a_large_name;	// kebab_case (not a common convention in JS)
var camelCase;	// camelCase (preferred in JS)
var thisIsWayItsCalledCamelCase;
var œÄ;
```









### Naming variables



#### *camelCase* convention

When creating a variable with more than one word, we use the ‚Äú**camelCase**‚Äù style.



#### Case sensitive

JavaScript is **case sensitive** so capital letters do make a difference. 



```js
var color = 'Red';
var Color;
// These are two different variables - JS is "case sensitive"
```







#### Reserved keywords - let, class, return, function

**[Keywords](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Lexical_grammar#Keywords)** are tokens that have special meaning in **JavaScript** and cannot be used as variable names. Most common ones are: `var`, `function`, `return`, `let`, `const`, `typeof`, `new`, `for` , etc. ...

```js
var var = "hello"; // <== error, you can't name variable "var"

var return = 'hola'; // <== error, you can't name variable "return"
```







### Dynamically typed

JavaScript is a **dynamically typed language** which means that **data type that variables are storing is not statically predetermined, but it is determined during the runtime**.

Statically typed languages like Java or C++ , require you to declare the data type of your variables before you use them. 

###### For example in Java (static typing):

##### `example.java`

```java
// Java example
int num;
num = 5;
```





Dynamically-typed languages do not require you to declare the data type of the variable. You can just go ahead and create the variable. The data type will be determied during the run-time.



 Simply put: variables in JavaScript can be assigned different value of a different type after they are declared/initially created.





#### Changing values

You can reassign values and change the data type of variables in JavaScript (excluding `const` variables).



```js
/* 
In JS we can reassign values of variables (except when using `const` variables)
*/


var favoriteFood = "Risotto";
console.log(favoriteFood); 

favoriteFood = "Pie";
console.log(favoriteFood);
console.log(typeof favoriteFood);

favoriteFood = 123;
console.log(favoriteFood);
console.log(typeof favoriteFood);

// console:
// Risotto
// Pie <== as we can see, the variable changed value from 'Risotto' to 'Pie'
// 123  <== as we can see, variable changed the data type from stirng to number
```



<br>







#### Redeclaring a variable -



When using `var` you have to be careful not to overwrite the existing variables, by re-declaring the variable with the same name.



```js
// Redeclaring a variable - careful not to overwrite existing variables

var favoriteCountry;

favoriteCountry = "Australia";


// Redeclaring a variable, removes the previous value.
// Be careful when using `var` not to redeclare/overwrite existing variables
var favoriteCountry = "JSland";

console.log(favoriteCountry);
```



## typeof

üîñ Sidenote: `typeof` is JavaScript operator that **returns the type of the variable** we passed to it. You can read more about it [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/typeof).



#### [ECMA Specs - Data types `typeof`](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/5.1/#sec-11.4.3)

```js
var myVar = "IronHack";

console.log(typeof myVar);

myVar = 100;

console.log(typeof myVar);
```







#### Quick Overview:  VARIABLE DECLARATION with `let` and `const`.

**`const`** is used to declare a variable whose value will be constant, remain unchanged.

These variables are called **constants** and if we try to change its values we will get the error back:



```js
// const
// `const` is used to declare a variable we want to remain unchanged, constant
// `const` forbids the assignment of a new value after the variable creation
// `const` must be assigned initial value, or it will throw error

const name = "Ana";
name = "Mariana";  // üö® TypeError: Assignment to constant variable;

// console:
// unknown: "name" is read-only
```



```js
const price; 
//  üö® SyntaxError: Missing initializer in const declaration
```



```js
// let
// `let` is used to declare variables whose value we plan to change later
// `let` can be declared empty, without an inital value

let student; // <== we can do this

```



**`let`** and `const` are used to create block scoped variables, which we will explain in the next days.







### ü•ÅImportant naming rules ü•Å

**naming variables is one of the hardest and most serious things in programming**. It might seem a bit silly, but badly named variables can jeopardize the development and the product itself.



### 



### [Recommended Reading - variable naming](https://www.robinwieruch.de/javascript-naming-conventions)



 You should always think about the next person who will work on your project 



The rules to keep in mind when naming a variable:

- keep variables easily understandable, **human-understandable** - **examples**



- never ever use `x`, `j`, `a` to name your variables unless it super clear to you and everyone else what is going on in the code.

  

- **name variables as descriptive and as concise as possible** (examples of good naming: *userName*, *creditCardNo*, and examples of bad names: `info`, `value`, etc. 

- if you‚Äôre working in a team you will most probably discuss the naming of the variables.







### Using the documentation - MDN



MDN is the foundation for every  front end developer. Every time you need to recall or check how a certain thing in JavaScript works you should look for it on the MDN documentation.
