# JS | JavaScript Intro

## Learning Goals

After this lesson you will be able to:

- Explain what JavaScript is and a bit of its history

- Explain what ES6 is and how JavaScript evolves

- Understand and apply basic JavaScript syntax

- Declare variables in JavaScript

- Properly name variables

  

## What is JavaScript?

**JavaScript is a lightweight compiled programming language with first-class functions**.



- **compiled programming language** - the JavaScript engine actually *compiles* the program on the fly and then immediately runs the compiled code.

  <u>Compiled language</u> <u>is compiled fully to the machine language</u>,  and then run. 

  

  <u>Interpreted language is being saved same as it is written no translating</u>, and is <u>translated line by line on runtime</u>. - faster in development but not as fast as compiled language.







- JavaScript was <u>created to run in the browser</u>  (mostly used for the Web) 

- but it is <u>also used in non-browser environments:</u> 
  - #### [Node.js (server side)](https://nodejs.org/en/) - created 2009 (by Ryan Dahl)
  - #### [Electron](https://electronjs.org/) - Desktop applications 





#### Evolving **language** - Until now JavaScript went through a lot of updates and changes.





#### [ECMAScript](https://electronjs.org/)

***ECMAScript* is the standard for JavaScript** and its implementation.(  it's most popular implementation.)



The versions of ECMAScript (shorter *ES*) that are still in use are :

- **ES5** (from 2009.), 

 - **ES6** (from 2015.),
 - **ES7** (2016.)



We will start with the  **ES5 **, but later you will use mostly **ES6** and the newer JavaScript features and syntax.



Enough of theory,  let‚Äôs move to JavaScript and  start writing  code.



## Basic JavaScript Syntax

- The **syntax** of a programming language is the **set of rules** that needs to be respected by programmers.
- JavaScript syntax has quite a few **curly braces** `{ `and **parentheses** `()`. - (the only similarity to Java)
- **Parentheses ()** and **curly braces {}** **are mandatory** and will cause an error if they‚Äôre left out. 
- **JavaScript** does not strictly require **semicolons**, however we use them always to prevent [possible errors](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/codebyte-why-are-explicit-semicolons-important-in-javascript-49550bea0b82/).







#### Example of an Output in Javascript 



We will use a function called `console.log()` to create an output. 

`console.log()` is your friend  :smiley:



```js
console.log('Hello Ironhackers');
```



#### Comments

Writing comments in your code is important 



- easy to find stuff in the code
- gives structure for others when reading your code

```js
// a short, one-line comment
```

```js
/* 
this is a longer,
multi-line comment
*/
```





## Variables

### What is a variable?

#### Variable is a named container or a storage for data in the memory.



The purpose behind naming them is actually to be able to **reference** them later on.



#### *different values* can be stored in variables, known as **datatypes in JavaScript**:

-  string
- number
-  array
-  object,
-  boolean
-  etc....



```js
var myString = "Uros";
var myNumber = 100;
var myArray = [];
var myObject = {};
var myBoolean = true; // true or false
```





### Declaring a variable in JavaScript

Before you can use a variable in a JavaScript, you have to **declare** it. 



Declaring simply means ‚Äúsaving a spot in a memory‚Äù without assigning any value to it. 



To **declare or define** a variable we can use keyword **let** or **const**.

in older versions of JavaScript, you will find keyword **var** which is used to declare variables. 



`var` is still used and there are few differences between **var**, **let** and **const** . 

**We will go over this differences a bit later.** 





#### VARIABLE DECLARATION with `var`

```js
var name;  // variable declaration
```

```js
var name, age, email; // Multiple variables declaration - one line
```



### variable initialization

After we declare a variable, we store some value in it. 

This is called **variable initialization.**

```js
name = 'John';  // variable initialization
age = 30;  // variable initialization
```





### variable initialization and declaration

#### We can make variable initialization at the time of variable creation.

```js
var name = 'John';  // variable declaration and initialization 
var age = 30;  // variable declaration and initialization
```







#### Naming a variable



Rules for naming variables:

1. Names **can contain letters** (uppercase and lowercase), **numbers** and the symbols `_`and `$`.
2. **The first character of the name can‚Äôt be a number.**





```js
var a; // the name is a, with var you are only introducing a variable.
var color;
var _private;
var $button;
var getTop10;
var a_large_name;
var thisWayIsCalledCamelCase;
var œÄ;
```





### Naming variables



#### *camelCase* convention

When creating a variable with more than one word, we use the ‚Äú**camelCase**‚Äù style.



#### Case sensitive

JavaScript is **case sensitive** so capital letters do make a difference. 



```js
let color = 'Red';
let Color;
// These are two different variables - JS is "case sensitive"
```







#### Reserved keywords - let, class, return, function

**[Keywords](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Lexical_grammar#Keywords)** are tokens that have special meaning in **JavaScript** and cannot be used as variable names. Most common ones are: `var`, `function`, `return`, `let`, `const`, `typeof`, `new`, `for` , etc. ...

```js
var var = "hello"; // <== error, you can't name variable "var"

var return = 'hola'; // <== error, you can't name variable "return"
```





### Dynamically typed

JavaScript is a **dynamically typed language** and that means **new variables can be created during the runtime**, and the **type of variables is determined at runtime**. 

 Simply put variable can be assigned different value of a different type at runtime.





#### Changing values

You can reassign values and change the data type of variables in JavaScript (excluding `const` variables).



```js
var favoriteFood;

favoriteFood = "Steak";
console.log(favoriteFood); 

favoriteFood = "Pizza";
console.log(favoriteFood);

// console:
// Steak
// Pizza <== as we can see, the variable changed value from 'Steak' to 'Pizza'
```







```js
var favoriteFood;

favoriteFood = "Steak";
console.log("Value: ",favoriteFood," Type: ", typeof favoriteFood);

/ Redeclaring a variable
var favoriteFood = "Cake";

favoriteFood = 20;
console.log("Value: ",favoriteFood," Type: ", typeof favoriteFood);

// console:
// Value:  Steak  Type:  string
// Value:  20     Type:  number
```



## typeof

üîñ Sidenote: `typeof` is JavaScript operator that **returns the type of the variable** we passed to it. You can read more about it [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/typeof).





```js
var myVar = "IronHack";

console.log(typeof myVar);

myVar = 100;

console.log(typeof myVar);
```







#### Quick Overview:  VARIABLE DECLARATION with `let` and `const`.

**`const`** is used when declaring a variable which value will be constant.

These variables are called **constants** and if we try to change its values we will get the error back:



```js
const name = "Ana";
name = "Marina";

// console:
// unknown: "name" is read-only
```

```js
let name; // <== we can do this

const price; // <== error üö® 
```



**`let`** is used to create a block scoped variable, which we will explain in the next days.







### ü•ÅImportant naming rules ü•Å

**naming variables is one of the hardest and most serious things in programming**. It might seem a bit silly, but badly named variables can jeopardize the development and the product itself.



 You should always think about the next person who will work on your project 



The rules to keep in mind when naming a variable:

- keep variables easily understandable, **human-understandable** - **examples**



- never ever use `x`, `j`, `a` to name your variables unless it super clear to you and everyone else what is going on in the code.

  

- **name variables as descriptive and as concise as possible** (examples of good naming: *userName*, *creditCardNo*, and examples of bad names: `info`, `value`, etc. 

- if you‚Äôre working in a team you will most probably discuss the naming of the variables.







### Using the documentation - MDN



MDN is the foundation for every  front end developer. Every time you need to recall or check how a certain thing in JavaScript works you should look for it on the MDN documentation.
