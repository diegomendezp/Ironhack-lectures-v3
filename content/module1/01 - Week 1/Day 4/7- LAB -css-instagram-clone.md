## Purpose:

## What they do in the exercise:
  - Clone the given page.

## Good practices:
  - Use element tags like ```<header>, <section>, etc.``` instead of ```<div>```.
  - Use relative paths for the images.
  - Use css reset.
  - Make the classes reusable.
  - Name classes with kebab-case instead of camelCase.
  - IDs are just for targeting single elements that won't be repeated.
  - Don't style element tags like ```div```.
  - Use relative units like vh,vw,% instead of absolute like px for positioning.
