# HTML & CSS | Recipes Clone

## Introduction

> ***Note:*** *This can be a pair programming activity or done independently.*

We've only learned the very basics today with HTML and CSS, so what the hell can we really build, right? Wrong, we can build some cool stuff already, and we're going to do just that.

We all have to eat (I think) so let's make some handy recipe pages for when we do. We're going to be recreating a French Onion Soup recipe, as well as an Apple Pie recipe.

Cloning something that already exists is the best way to get better at front end development, so check out the deliverable below to see what we're expecting.

There's a bit of starter code, so you can jump right into it.

## Requirements

- [Learn how to fork this repo](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/)
- Clone this repo into your `~/code/labs`
- Make sure you use `class` and `id` selectors throughout your exercise. Remember, only use type selectors if you want to modify *every* element of that type
- Use a single external CSS stylesheet to style all pages
- Use the images provided to construct the appropriate elements on the page:
  - The background with a picture of the apple pie / french onion soup
  - The recipe servings / nutrients section
  - The prep section

## Submission

Upon completion, run the following commands

```
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "done"
$ git push origin master
```

Navigate to your repo and create a Pull Request -from your master branch to the original repository master branch.

In the Pull request name, add your name and last names separated by a dash "-"

## Starter code

The starter-code contains all the files, images, and text content needed to create the page. The text is in the `index.html`, and a css file is created in `main.css`.
