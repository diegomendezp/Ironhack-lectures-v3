## Learning Objectives

- position: 
  - static
  - relative
  - absolute
  - fixed

- used with `top/left` displaces the element (but the original space is still occupied)
- establishes an anchor for absoulte descendent
- element complete leaves the flow
- and looses its natural block ability of being `width 100%`
- used with `top/left`, always relative to first `absolute` OR `relative` ancestor
