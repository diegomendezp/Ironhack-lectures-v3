## Purpose:
  - Practise css selectors
  - Practise css transitions and animations
## What they do in the exercise:
  - Clone the given page
  - Use at least one descendant selector and one multiple selector
  - Animate the logo when hover
## Good practices:
  - Use element tags like ```<header>, <section>, etc``` instead of ```<div>```
  - Navbar menu should be a ```<ul>```; perfect case to apply a descendant selector
  - Use relative paths for the images
  - Use css reset
  - Make the classes reusable
  - Name classes with kebab-case instead of camelCase
  - IDs are just for targeting single elements that wont be repeated
  - Don't style element tags like ```<div>```
  - Use relative units like vh,vw,% instead of absolute like px for positioning
  - You don't finish to style an element until you've set its margin bottom / padding top



## Issues:
  - Not enough transitions/animations
## Suggestion:
