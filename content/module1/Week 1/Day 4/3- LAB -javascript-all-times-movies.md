## Link:
  - https://github.com/ironhack-labs/lab-javascript-all-times-movies
## Purpose:
  - Practise arrays advanced methods: map, reduce, filter, sort
## What they do in the exercise:
  - I1: change duration of all movies (map)
  - I2: get all rates average (reduce)
  - I3: average rate of just drama movies (filter + reduce)
  - I4: order movies by duration (sort)
  - I5: get drama when SS is the director
  - I6: sort all movies alphabetically and return a list of first 20
  - I7: check which year has best average rate
## Good practices:
  - check the MDN documentation to see the syntax of the methods 
  - arguments should be self-explaining Just because we are in the first week is better than defining them as elem or item



## Issues:
  - I1 is time consuming for the purpose of the exercise
  - Splice is repeated in the learning unit:
     - http://learn.ironhack.com/#/learning_unit/3037
     - http://learn.ironhack.com/#/learning_unit/3021
  - missing reverse and splice
  - reverse should be in the arrays unit: Week1 Day2
  - iteration 2 test with numbers and the data (rate) is a string
## Suggestion:
  - Make the exercise I2 > I3 > I5 > I6 > I1 > I4 > Bonus
## Typos:
  - `index.html` has wrong script link
