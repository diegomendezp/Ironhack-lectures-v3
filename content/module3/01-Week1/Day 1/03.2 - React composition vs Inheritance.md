# React composition vs Inheritance 





## Introduction

**Never use inheritance when working with React components.**





React was created by Facebook. Quoting them:

> “At Facebook, we use React in thousands of components, and we haven’t found any use cases where we would recommend creating component inheritance hierarchies.
> Props and composition give you all the flexibility you need to customize a component’s look and behavior in an explicit and safe way.

## Composition in React components



Other than passing regular props we can also pass other elements or components. We call this composition.



Using the special **props.children** in React we can  pass children elements directly into the component's output:



##### `src/FancyBorder.js`

```js
import React from "react";
import './FancyBorder.css';

function FancyBorder(props) {
  return (
    <div className='fancy'>
    	<h3>{props.title}<h3>
      {props.children}
    </div>
  );
}

export default FancyBorder;
```





##### `src/FancyBorder.css`

```css
.fancy {
  border: 5px dashed magenta;
  border-radius: 15px;
  background: rebeccapurple;
}
```



##### `src/App.js`

```js
import FancyBorder from './FancyBorder.js'

// ...


    <FancyBorder title='Fancy Box Example'>
      <h1>Welcome to Fancy Box</h1>
      <p>Thank you for visiting our spacecraft!</p>
    </FancyBorder>
  
```











Props and composition give you all the flexibility you need to customize a component’s look and behavior in an explicit and safe way.

Remember that components may accept arbitrary props, including primitive values, React elements, or functions.
