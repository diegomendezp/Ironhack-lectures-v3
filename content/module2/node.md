## Lecture Notes

- What is Node.js?
  - **IT'S NOT A FRAMEWORK!**
  - runtime environment for running javascript in the backend (v8 engine)
  - app can be an http server (runs "forever")
  - runs javascript, same as browser (but no window, no DOM)
  - node callbacks convention (err, result) => { ... }
  - has some built-in modules like `fs`, `process`, `path` and `http`

- Modules
  - every js file is a module
  - every file has it's own scope (no global scope)
  - npm packages are also modules
  - for our files:
    - in `folder/mymodule.js`, to define what it exports
      - `module.exports = ...`
    - in another file use relative path to require it
      - `const mymodule = require('./folder/mymodule')`
  - for npm packages:
    - const express = require('express')

- Why Node.js
  - Installing Node.js

- NPM
  - Installing Packages
  - the console `node` command
  - `npm init` (new projects only)
  - `npm install` (after cloning existing project)
  - `npm install --save package-name` development and production
  - `npm install --save-dev package-name` only development
  - `npm install -g package-name` (may require sudo) glabal install
  - `package.json` (every node project needs one)
	- [NPM](http://npmjs.org)

  {{% notice warning %}}
  - always add "node_modules" to .gitignore ðŸ’£
  {{% /notice %}}

- main use case: http server

- other Node.js use cases, not only http servers
  - node-sass, webpack, gulp, grunt
  - babel

<!-- 
- build a quote generator w/ functions + array modules + chalk
- create repo in github for the codealong: https://github.com/tawebbcn/node-intro
  - remember the gitignore
- made the cohort clone the repo of the person to the right for them to find out that it won't work
  - introduce npm install

function getRandomIntInclusive(min, max) {
  min = Math.ceil(min);
  max = Math.floor(max);
  return Math.floor(Math.random() * (max - min + 1)) + min; //The maximum is inclusive and the minimum is inclusive 
}
