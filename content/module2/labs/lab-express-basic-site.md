## Link:
  - https://github.com/ironhack-labs/lab-express-basic-site

## Purpose:
  - They have to create a basic site with express.
  - They must choose a topic for that website (could be a celebrity, Tv Show, Futbol Player, etc...)

## What they do in the exercise:
  - They have to create a 3 pages (at least) website: HOME, ABOUT & PHOTO GALLERY.
  - Start becoming familiar with Node/Express
  

## Good practices:
  - Pay attention into the project Folder structure, maintain it clean and follow the SOC (Separation Of Concerns )principle & Encapsulation principle.
  - Take advantage of comments to virtually spliting a fille into diferrent block (Important for App.js) so they will become more familiar with the express way.
