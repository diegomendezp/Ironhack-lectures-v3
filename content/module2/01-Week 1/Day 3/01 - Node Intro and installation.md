# Node



## Lecture Brief

- What is a CLI

- V8 Engine:

  - written in C++

  - used in Browser with Web APIs, 

  - converts JS to machine language.

    

- NodeJS environment:  V8 engine with added C++ functionality ,so that it can run on the server.

  

- What can NodeJS do: 

  -  create a server, 

  - load multiple files as modules, 

  - I/O  - working with files,

  - work with databases, 

  - listen to HTTP messages & send HTTP messages. 

    

- Installing NodeJS. NodeJS automatically comes with the `npm`.

- Run a `test.js` file  that `console.log`s, from terminal with `node`.

  

- NPM - node package manager:

  -  What is it?  - 

    - It is a CLI - package manager software, 

    - JS packages (files) repository,

      

  - Play **NPM Intro video**.

  - NVM - is a node version manager - used to manage which version of NodeJS is installed.

  - NodeJS installation comes with `npm` bundled.

  - Check what version of `npm` you have - `npm --version` .

    

- Installing packages:

  - Initialize `npm` in our project that creates `package.json` - `npm init` 

  - Show and explain `package.json`

  - Explain `npm install <package>` vs `npm install --save ` vs `npm install --save-dev`

  - `dependencies` vs `devDependencies`  in the running/deployed apps vs development.

  - Install `chalk` as dependency: `npm install --save chalk`

  - Install `nodemon` as devDependency: `npm install --save-dev nodemon`

    

- Setup `.gitignore` to prevent commiting `node_modules` dir.

- NodeJS `require / module.exports`  and  ES6 `import/export`

- Extra: `npm publish` can be used.

## Lecture *** 



### CLI

Command Line interface - Program where you type things in your computer rather than clicking - example Bash on Linux, Terminal on Mac, Command Prompt on Windows.



When working with node.js you will be working with it from the Command Line Interface , CLI .





## V8 The Javascript engine - (at the heart of Node.js)

Machine language is a language that your computer processor speaks and it is very low level.

- Google's V8 engine is a JavaScript Engine written in C++.

- V8 engine converts JavaScript into machine language and gives it to the processor.

- V8 was initially made to be used in the browser,  however V8 can run alone. This means that you can use the V8 code and combine it with another C++ application / program.

- Node.js is a V8 engine with some additional C++ code added, that enables you to run JavaScript outside of the browser.

#### Node provides features that are not available in the browser, like:  

- ##### creating a server.

- ##### ability to accept HTTP requests and send HTTP responses.

- ##### loading multiple JavaScript files as modules.

- ##### Working with files (write to the hard drive, load files).

- ##### Working with databases.

  

Node.js is a server technology and a JavaScript runtime environment, it is not a framework nor a programming language.

## Installing Node.js

#### [~~nvm - Instructions~~](<http://materials.ironhack.com/s/BySQC2fpVE7#installing-node>)



#### [NodeJS - official page](https://nodejs.org/en/)



<br>



### Using NodeJS



##### Create a file `test.js`

```bash
touch test.js
```





##### Add some content to the `test.js`



##### `test.js`

```js
console.log("Hello Node");
```



##### Run the file from the terminal:

```bash
node test.js
```

## NPM - node package manager and modules

<br>

### What is  node package manager?



- `npm` is a Node Package manager that enables us to download and install different JavaScript files called 'packages' or 'modules' into our project.
- Other alternative package manager is Yarn, however yarn is out of scope of this lecture and we will be using only `npm` as our package manager.



<br>



### `npm` consists of 3 things:

1. `npm` CLI used to get the packages and it is also a server for all the packages.

2. `npm` registry that is the database used to keep and serve the packages.
3. npm website - NPM  documentation. It aslo contains information for every published package.



<br>



### Packages (modules)



- **Modules** aka packages are bundles of reusable code that are packaged with any of the code they depend on (dependencies). 



- One package can be build of several other packages. We call them dependencies, when one package depend on others to be installed as well.



- When an `npm` package that we are using is updated by the package owner, we get the notification that package in our app needs an update. In this way maintaining the code is more sustainable.





Packages aka modules start from silly things such as getting the funny **vaca** printed on your terminal to an entire framework like React that you can get and install in your project.



<br>



To check if your npm was installed with node, in your terminal run :

```bash
npm --version
```



<br>



## [Get Started with `npm` - npm intro video](<https://docs.npmjs.com/about-npm/>) (3 min)



<br>





## Installing packages

- In order to install packages in our project we have to create a `package.json` file. 

- `package.json` is a manifest file that tells Node and us, what packages (aka dependencies) are installed in our project.





#### `npm init` creates a `package.json` file

```bash
mkdir npm-getting-started
cd npm-getting-started
touch index.js

npm init
```



<br>

`npm init` will initiate a prompt of questions to be answered for the setup of the `package.json` file.



<br>





```bash
npm install --save chalk
```

`npm install` grabs the package from the npm servers

`--save` flag adds adds the package to our `package.json` file under `dependencies` .

`node_moudles` folders is then created. This is where the acctual code for all packages is stored.



If we want to have the module only for development and not for deployment, we can save it as a Development Dependency, using flag `--save-dev`

```bash
npm install --save-dev nodemon
```





<br>



### Differences between:

###  `npm install`,

###  `npm install --save` and

###  `npm install --save-dev`



#### [OPEN IMAGE](https://i.imgur.com/JbO1G2D.png)

![](https://i.imgur.com/JbO1G2D.png)



<br>



1. `npm install` will install the npm package to the node_modules folder  without adding it to the `package.json`
2. `npm install --save` - package(s) required by the application to run
3. `npm install --save-dev` - package(s) required for development purpose.



<br>



### `dependencies`

`dependencies` are 3rd-party packages that the application needs in order to run or function. These packages will be deployed with the production version of the app and will be downloaded to the user’s browser cache whenever someone uses the app/website. In case of the back-end apps `dependencies` are installed during the deployment and are required on the machine instance where the server is running. 



### `devDependencies`

`devDependencies` are used only during the development of the app, only by the developers of the in order to build and test the app. These packages are not deployed in the production version and will not be downloaded to the browser cache of end users or to the server in case of the back-end apps.



<br>



### Setting `.gitignore` ( omit the `node_modules`  folder)



#### Do not `commit` the node_modules. It will make your repository a lot larger!

- If you commit only `package.json`, any user will be able to recreate your `node_modules` by simply running `npm install`.

- We use the `.gitignore` file to add `node_moudles` to the list of files and folders that will not be commited.



<br>



#### Setting the `.gitignore`  file.



```bash
touch .gitignore
```



```js
# Dependency directories
node_modules/
```





<br>



### Node `require()/module.exports`  VS  ES6 `import/export`



<br>

#### NodeJS - `require()` / `module.exports`

`require` is the standard module loading API for the *NodeJS*, which means that in order to load or export a file/module in NodeJS environment, we have to use the `require` and `module.exports` statements.



<br>



#### ES6 - `import`  / `export`

 

ES6 introduced `import` and `export` syntax, however for this to work on our NodeJS project we have to setup `Babel` transpilation (translating) of the code from `import/export` syntax to `require` syntax that NodeJS uses.



<br>



### Use the installed package

Let's use our package.

To import a module and use it in our script we use the NodeJS' built in`require()` method.



##### `test.js`

```js
const chalk = require('chalk');

// console.log('Hello Node'); 

console.log(chalk.green('Hello ironhackers'));
console.log(chalk.yellow.bgRed.bold('Hello ironhackers'));
```



<br>Check out the *chalk* package `npm` page - https://www.npmjs.com/package/chalk



<br>



#### Exporting a module `module.exports` con

Let's create a file that will contain greeting messages that we want to use.

```bash
touch greetings.js
```



##### `greetings.js`

```js
const greetings = {
  en: 'Hello Ironhackers',
  es: 'Hola Ironhackers',
  de: 'Hallo Ironhackers',
  fr: 'Salut Ironhackers',
};

/* 
We export the greetings object, in order to be able to 
require it from another file.
*/
 module.exports = greetings;

```



We can now load the exported module/file in our `test.js` file



##### `test.js`

```js
const chalk = require('chalk');
const greet = require('./greetings'); // .js extension is not compulsory
/*

greet = {
  en: 'Hello Ironhackers',
  es: 'Hola Ironhackers',
  de: 'Hallo Ironhackers',
  fr: 'Salut Ironhackers'
}

*/

console.log(chalk.whiteBright.bgBlue.bold(greet.en));
console.log(chalk.yellow.bgRed.bold(greet.es));
console.log(chalk.bgYellowBright(greet.de));
console.log(
  chalk.whiteBright.bgBlueBright(greet.fr.split(' ')[0]),
  chalk.blueBright.bgRed(greet.fr.split(' ')[1]),
);

```
