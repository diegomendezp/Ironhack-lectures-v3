## Fields in the HTTP Request Headers

------

GET /hello.htm HTTP/1.1
**User-Agent:** Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE5.01; Windows NT)
**Host**: www.tutorialspoint.com
**Accept-Encoding:** gzip, deflate
**Connection**: Keep-Alive



1st line - Method, URI, HTTP version



Line 2 - **User-Agent**: Client browser info, where the request is originating from.



Line 3 - **Host:** specifies the Internet host and port number of the resource being requested



Line 4 - **Accept-Encoding:**  restricts the content-codings that are acceptable in the response.



Line 5 - **Connection:** When you make requests with "**keep-alive**" the subsequent request to the server will use the same TCP connection. 

This is called HTTP persistent connection. This helps in reducing CPU load on the server side and improves latency/response time.
