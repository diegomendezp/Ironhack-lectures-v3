- Database collection relationship types:
  - Foreign key
  - 1:1 - One-To-One
  - 1:N - One-To-Many
    - embedding instead of using One-To-Many relationship :thumbsdown:
  - N:M - Many-To-Many
    - Example with `ObjectId`s
    - Simplify the example using numbers (1,2,3) instead of `ObjectId`s

#### [Normalization - CS Wiki](https://computersciencewiki.org/index.php/Normalization)

- **Normalization is a database design method and a process of systematically breaking a complex collecition / table into simpler, smaller, easier to manage collections/ tables**.
- Purpose of Normalization is to produce a clearer, more readable and more scalable data model.







## Document relationships

Designing data models for MongoDB applications focuses on the structure of documents and how it represents relationships between data. 

We can create relationships between collections in Two ways:



- Referencing documents
- Embedding documents



## Referencing documents - Relations





- **Reference** stores the relationships between data by including ids from one document to another. 
- Structures of collections that use references to store and organize documents are  called **normalized** data models.

If we want to get the `contact` information document from `contacts` collection for a particular user , 

first we’ll get the `_id` of the user from `user` collection, and then we’ll make a second query to obtain the contact information based on the `_id` obtained previously.





### Referencing Example



###### USER COLLECTION

```js
{
   _id: ObjectId("593e7a1a4299c306d656200f"),	// U1
   name: "Willy",
   lastName: "Doe",
   email: "willydow@gmail.com",
   birthday: 1990-12-14 01:00:00.000,
   phone: "123412399"
}
```



###### ADDRESS COLLECTION

```js
{
   _id: ObjectId("59f30dd86f0b06a96e31bbb9"),		// A1
   street: "123 Fake Street",
   city: "Faketon",
   state: "MA",
   zip: "12345",
   user: ObjectId("593e7a1a4299c306d656200f"),		// U1
}
```





<br>



**To get the address of the current user, we need 2 queries :**

```js

db.users.findOne({ email: "willydow@gmail.com"}, { _id: 1 });		
// This returns an ObjectId("593e7a1a4299c306d656200f")


db.address.find(
  { user: ObjectId("593e7a1a4299c306d656200f") }		// U1
)

/* This returns the address object

{
   _id: ObjectId("59f30dd86f0b06a96e31bbb9"),		//	A1
   street: "123 Fake Street",
   city: "Faketon",
   state: "MA",
   zip: "12345",
   user: ObjectId("593e7a1a4299c306d656200f"),	// U1
}

*/
```





<br>





## Embedding documents

Another way of relating documents is by **embedding them**, saving the related document inside the main one. As you can see in the following picture:

Previous example, but this time with embedded documents:



###### USER COLLECTION (with embedded **Address**)

```js
{
  _id: ObjectId("593e7a1a4299c306d656200f"),
  name: "Willy",
  lastName: "Doe",
  email: "willydow@gmail.com",
  birthday: 1990-12-14 01:00:00.000,
  phone: "123412399",
    
  address: {
    street: "123 Fake Street",
    city: "Faketon",
    state: "MA",
    zip: "12345"
  }
  
}
```





**to get the users address:**

```js
db.user.find(
  { _id: ObjectId("593e7a1a4299c306d656200f") }
)
```





### Embedding Multiple Sub-documents

When we have multiple documents (sub-documents) that can embed in the same component, in this case, `addresses` will be an array of objects.

```js
{
   _id: ObjectId("593e7a1a4299c306d656200f"),
  name: "Willy",
  lastName: "Doe",
  email: "willydow@gmail.com",
  birthday: 1990-12-14 01:00:00.000,
  phone: "123412399",
  addresses: [
    {
      street: "123 Fake Street",
      city: "Faketon",
      state: "MA",
      zip: "12345"
    },
    {
      street: "1 Some Other Street",
      city: "Boston",
      state: "MA",
       zip: "12345"
     }
  ]
}
```

## Defining Your Document Schema

When designing the database you should start the schema design process by considering the application use, query requirements, and how each document or collection will be linked to each other.

When designing we use the relationship types to describe how collections link to eachother.



<br>



## Relationship types

Referencing the documents from other collections via the foreign key (Unique id) enables us to scale our database and normalize it to avoid duplication of data.





#### Foreign key  - Unique id of a document from another collection





#### One-To-One (1:1)

One document (collection) holds only 1 <u>reference</u> to <u>one document</u> <u>in another collection</u>.

The connection between these 2 documents in the opposite collections is unique.



#### One-To-Many (1:N)

One document (collection) is referenced by <u>many other</u> <u>documents</u> <u>in another collection</u>, while the other side's (Many) relationship is only to a single document.





#### Many-To-Many (N:M)

Is the <u>relation between 2 collections</u> where <u>each collection's documents</u> can have <u>many connections to the opposite collection</u>. 

Two connecting connections can have many relationships between each other.





<br>



<hr>



## 1:1



### Model One-to-One (1:1) Relationships

One document (collection) holds only 1 <u>reference</u> to <u>one document</u> <u>in another collection</u>. 

The connection between these 2 documents in the opposite collections is unique.





###### USER COLLECTION

```js
{
   _id: ObjectId("593e7a1a4299c306d656200f"),	// U1
   name: "Bob Codebraker",
   email: "bob.codebraker@mail.com"
}
```

###### ADDRESS COLLECTION

```js
{
   _id: ObjectId("3f2e4b1a4299c306d656200f"),	// A1
   user_id: ObjectId("593e7a1a4299c306d656200f"),
   street: "123 Fake Street",
   city: "Faketon",
   state: "MA",
   zip: "12345"
}
```





#### Embedding is sometimes preferred

In the One-to-One relationship Embedding can be choosed as the preferred way to model the relationship if it will be the more efficient to retrieve the document (1 query instead of 2 queries).



<br>







<br>

## 1:N

### Model One-to-Many Relationships 

One document (collection) is referenced by <u>many other</u> <u>documents</u> <u>in another collection</u>, while the other side's (Many) relationship is only to a single document.



###### USER COLLECTION

```js
{
   _id: U1,
   name: "Bob Codebraker",
   email: "bob.codebraker@mail.com"
}
```



###### ADDRESS COLLECTION

```js
{
   _id: A1,
   street: "123 Fake Street",
   city: "Faketon",
   user: U1
}

{
   _id: A2,
   street: "1 Some Other Street",
   city: "Boston",
   user: U1
}
```





<br>





###   :thumbsdown: Embedding instead of using One-To-Many relationship  - :thumbsdown:

The above approach with embedded documents would cause <u>duplication of data</u> in the Address collection. Therefore referencing is a better approach.

###### ADDRESS COLLECTION

```js
{
  _id: ObjectId("3f2e4b1a4299c306d656200f"),	// A1
  street: "123 Fake Street",
  city: "Faketon",
	user: {
  	name: "Bob Codebraker",
   	email: "bob.codebraker@mail.com"
	}
}

{
  _id: ObjectId("15fe7a12f29dc36d65632f0c"),	// A2
  street: "1 Some Other Street",
  city: "Boston",
  user: {
  	name: "Bob Codebraker",
   	email: "bob.codebraker@mail.com"
	}
}
```



<br>





## N:M

### Many-To-Many Relationship (Two way embedding) - Example



###### USER COLLECTION

```js
{
   _id: ObjectId("7f337a1a42f9c305d656201d"),	// U1
   name: "Andy Debuggerowski",
   addresses: [ ObjectId("3f2e4b1a4299c306d656200f") ]	// A1
},

{
   _id: ObjectId("593e7a1a4299c306d656200f"), // U2
   name: "Bob Codebreaker",
   addresses: [
     ObjectId("3f2e4b1a4299c306d656200f"),	// A1
     ObjectId("15fe7a12f29dc36d65632f0c")		// A2
   ]
}
```



###### ADDRESS COLLECTION

```js
{
   _id: ObjectId("3f2e4b1a4299c306d656200f"),	// A1
   street: "123 Fake Street",
   city: "Faketon",
   description: 'Hippster Inc. Headquarters',
   users: [
     ObjectId("7f337a1a42f9c305d656201d"),	// U1
     ObjectId("593e7a1a4299c306d656200f")		// U2
   ]
},

{
   _id: ObjectId("15fe7a12f29dc36d65632f0c"),	// A2
   street: "2010 Marvel Ave",
   city: "Metropolis",
   description: 'Apartment',
   users: [ObjectId("593e7a1a4299c306d656200f")]	// U2
}
```





<br>



#### Many-To-Many Simplified



###### USER COLLECTION

```javascript
{
   _id: U1,
   name: "Andy Debuggerowski",
   addresses: [ A1 ]
},

{
   _id: U2,
   name: "Bob Codebreaker",
   addresses: [ A1, A2 ]
}
```



###### ADDRESS COLLECTION

```js
{
   _id: A1,
   street: "123 Fake Street",
   city: "Faketon",
   description: 'Hippster Inc. Headquarters',
   users: [ U1, U2 ]
},

{
   _id: A2,
   street: "2010 Marvel Ave",
   city: "Metropolis",
   description: 'Apartment',
   users: [ U2 ]
}
```
