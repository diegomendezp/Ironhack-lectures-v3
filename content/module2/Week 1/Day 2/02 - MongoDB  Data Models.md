## Document Structure

Designing data models for MongoDB applications revolves around the structure of documents and how it represents relationships between data. We can do this in Two ways:



- Referencing documents
- Embedding documents







## Referencing documents - Relations





### References store the relationships between data by including links or ids from one document to another. 

### These are  called normalized data models.

#### Normalization is a logical data base design method. 

#### Normalization is a process of systematically breaking a complex table / collection into simpler, smaller collections/ tables.

###  Purpose of Normalization is to produce a clearer and readable data model.

If we want to get the `contact` information document from `contacts` collection for a particular user , 

first we’ll get the `_id` of the user from `user` collection, and then we’ll make a second query to obtain the contact information based on the `_id` obtained previously.





Example 2



**User** Collection

```js
{
   _id: ObjectId("593e7a1a4299c306d656200f"),
   name: "Willy",
   lastName: "Doe",
   email: "willydow@gmail.com",
   birthday: 1990-12-14 01:00:00.000,
   phone: "123412399"
}
```

**Address** Collection

```js
{
   _id: ObjectId("59f30dd86f0b06a96e31bbb9"),
   user_id: ObjectId("593e7a1a4299c306d656200f"),
   street: "123 Fake Street",
   city: "Faketon",
   state: "MA",
   zip: "12345"
}
```

## Embedding documents

Another way of relating documents is by **embedding them**, saving the related document inside the main one. As you can see in the following picture:

The same example of using embedded documents:

```js
{
  _id: ObjectId("593e7a1a4299c306d656200f"),
  name: "Willy",
  lastName: "Doe",
  email: "willydow@gmail.com",
  birthday: 1990-12-14 01:00:00.000,
  phone: "123412399",
  address: {
    street: "123 Fake Street",
    city: "Faketon",
    state: "MA",
    zip: "12345"
  }
}
```





### Multiple Sub-documents

When we have multiple documents (subdocuments) that can embed in the same component, in this case, `addresses` will be an array of objects.

```js
{
   _id: ObjectId("593e7a1a4299c306d656200f"),
  name: "Willy",
  lastName: "Doe",
  email: "willydow@gmail.com",
  birthday: 1990-12-14 01:00:00.000,
  phone: "123412399",
  addresses: [
    {
      street: "123 Fake Street",
      city: "Faketon",
      state: "MA",
      zip: "12345"
    },
    {
      street: "1 Some Other Street",
      city: "Boston",
      state: "MA",
       zip: "12345"
     }
  ]
}
```





## Defining Your Document Schema

#### You should start the schema design process by considering the application use, query requirements, and how each document or collection will be linked to each other.







### Model One-to-One Relationships with Embedded Documents



```js
{
   _id: ObjectId("593e7a1a4299c306d656200f"),
   name: "Joe Bookreader"
}


{
   patron_id: ObjectId("593e7a1a4299c306d656200f"),
   street: "123 Fake Street",
   city: "Faketon",
   state: "MA",
   zip: "12345"
}
```





### Model One-to-Many Relationships with Embedded Documents



```js
{
   _id: ObjectId("593e7a1a4299c306d656200f"),
   name: "Joe Bookreader"
}

{
   patron_id: ObjectId("593e7a1a4299c306d656200f"),
   street: "123 Fake Street",
   city: "Faketon",
   state: "MA",
   zip: "12345"
}

{
   patron_id: ObjectId("593e7a1a4299c306d656200f"),
   street: "1 Some Other Street",
   city: "Boston",
   state: "MA",
   zip: "12345"
}
```
