Good evening team, I hope that everyone is healthy and doing fine. :muscle: :slightly_smiling_face:

Just an update on our mock interviews scheduled for the next week.
Due to the current situation we will do the mock interviews online using Zoom (https://zoom.us).

Please download and install the platform (Mac users) before your scheduled time slot. If you are unable to install the app on your laptop, you will still be able to access the meeting using the web app via the link https://zoom.us/join. The best thing would be to create a Zoom account even if you canâ€™t download the app.
Please check it ahead of time to ensure that you have Zoom account setup. :slightly_smiling_face:

The topics that we will go over are:
closure,
 this in JS,
 prototypal inheritance,
data types in JS (value vs reference),
scope.

The recommended lecture summaries that may be useful for you before the mock interviews and the overall interview phase are:
