## Link:
  - https://github.com/ironhack-labs/lab-css-flexbox-slack
## Purpose:
  - Practise css flex-box
  - Practise css responsive design with media queries
## What they do in the exercise:
  - Clone the given page
  - I1: mobile first with menu burger
  - I2: small screen
  - I3: medium screen
  - I4: Large screen
## Good practices:
  - Mobile first
  - Flex-box instead of float
  - Use element tags like `<header>`, `<section>`, etc instead of `<div>`
  - Navbar menu should be a `<ul>`; perfect case to apply a descendant selector
  - Use relative paths for the images
  - Use css reset
  - Make the classes reusable
  - Name classes with kebab-case instead of camelCase
  - IDs are just for targeting single elements that wont be repeated
  - Don't style element tags like `<div>` unless for resetting OR inside a class (e.g. `.main h3 {}`)
  - Use relative units like % instead of absolute like px for positioning
  - You don't finish to style an element until you've set its margin bottom / padding top


  
## Issues:
  - Too much images and gifs in the explanation, it's hard to understand
## Suggestion:
  - It should have a PDF like the spotify clone Week1 Day3
