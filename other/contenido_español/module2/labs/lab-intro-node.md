## Link:
  - https://github.com/ironhack-labs/lab-intro-node
## Purpose:
  - First touch with nodeJS
  - Get aquainted with using javascript and seeing be executed without a browser
  - Learn more about testing and Mocha as a tool for testing
  - Last look at ES5 constructors before moving on to ES6

## What they do in the exercise:
  - They have a set of tests provided to them and they have to make them all pass
  - The following code is provided
  ```
  var SortedList = function() {};
  SortedList.prototype.add     = function(item) {}
  SortedList.prototype.get     = function(pos) {}
  SortedList.prototype.max     = function() {}
  SortedList.prototype.min     = function() {}
  SortedList.prototype.average = function() {}
  SortedList.prototype.sum     = function() {}
  ```

## Good practices:
  - Indentation and constructor review

## Issues:
  - In order to pass the first test #add(x) you need to implement the #get(i) method.
  - In #get(i) method it starts counting position as if 1 were 0.

## Suggestion:

## Typos:
