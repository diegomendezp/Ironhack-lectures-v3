## Removing `node_modules/` folder from github repo retrospectively





If you've already committed `node_modules`, and then later added the `node_modules/` to your`.gitignore` later , it will not work retroactively and node_modules/ directory will stll be present on the github.





You need to remove the cached `node_modules/`  and commit the snapshot again

```bash
git rm -r --cached node_modules
```
