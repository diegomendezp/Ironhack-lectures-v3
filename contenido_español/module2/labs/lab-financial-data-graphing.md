## Purpose:
  - Practice fetching data from an API
  - Learn how to modify the data and pass it to chartJS to build a graph
  - Learn how to work with both an external API and an library at the same time

## What they do in the exercise:
  - I1: Get Data
  - I2: Create Chart
  - I3: Dates Filter
  - I4(Bonus): Currency
  - I5(Bonus): Max/Min Values

## Good practices:
  - Make sure you load the javascript code on the front end that fetches the data and generates the graphs

## Issues:
  - Templates on the boilerplate are in ejs format
  - I5 asks to use Math Min/Max with apply instead of the newer spread operator(...)
