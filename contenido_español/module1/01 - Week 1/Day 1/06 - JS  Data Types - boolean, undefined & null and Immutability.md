# JS | Data Types in JavaScript-boolean, undefined & null and Immutability

## Learning Goals

After this lesson you will be able to:

- Use boolean as data type
- Use undefined and null as a data types
- Understand primitives and immutability





## A boolean as data type

A **Boolean** or **bool** has a value of **TRUE** or **FALSE**.

A boolean expression is an expression that returns `true` or `false` 

Booleans are often used in conditional statements.



```js
// Boolean 

var booleanTrue = true;
var booleanFalse = false;

console.log(booleanTrue); // true
console.log(booleanFalse); // false

console.log(10 > 1)   // true
console.log(10 < 1)   // false
```







## Logic operators

We use logical operators to combine multiple conditions and to get as a result a **true** or a **false**.

We have three different logical operators: **OR**, **AND** and **NOT**.



#### OR Operator (`||`)

Returns `true` even if only **one of the evaluated expressions is `true`**.

```js
var expr1 = true;
var expr2 = false;

expr1 || expr2	// true
```

If they both are `false`, the result of the expression will be `false`.



```js
true  || true       // => true
true  || false      // => true
false || true       // => true
false || false      // => false
false || (4 > 2)    // true
```





#### AND Operator (`&&`)

The **AND** operator, represented by `&&`, returns true just if **BOTH evaluated expressions are true**.

```js
expr1 && expr2
```

```js
true  && true       // => true
true  && false      // => false
false && true       // => false
false && false      // => false
true  && (4 > 2)    // => true
```





#### Short-circuit evaluation - ( ||,  && )

As logical expressions in JavaScript are evaluated left to right, they are tested for possible “short-circuit” evaluation using the following rules:

```js
// AND operator
false && (anything) is short-circuit evaluated to false.

// OR operator
true || (anything) is short-circuit evaluated to true.
```

The rules of logic guarantee that these evaluations are **always correct**. Note that the anything part of the above expressions is not evaluated, so any side effects of doing so do not take effect.









Example:

```js
let a = false;
let b = false;
let c = false;
let d = 4;
let e = 'five';
let result = a || b || c || d || e;

// What is the value of `result` ?
console.log(result);
```





#### NOT Operator (`!`)

Used to negate the value of an expression.

```
!expr1
```

If the expression is **true**, the result will be **false**, and vice versa.

```js
!true 		// => false
!false 		// => true
!(4 > 2) 	// => false
```





## An `undefined` as data type

**undefined** is primitive value automatically assigned to variables when they are declared.

```
let name;
console.log(name); // <== undefined
```



## A `null` as data type

In CS, a **null** value represents a reference that points to a nonexistent memory address, meaning the variable that hasn't been even declared yet.



In JavaScript, `null` is an assignment value. It can be assigned to a variable as a representation of no value.

We typically use to initialize the variable in which we want to store an object later.

```js
let name = null;
console.log(name); // <== null
```



### 	`typeof null` is "object"

**This stands since the beginning of *JavaScript*** `typeof *null* === 'object';` 

 You can consider it a *bug* in *JavaScript* that typeof *null* is an object.

This is a **bug**, that unfortunately can't be fixed, because it would break existing code.



#### [ECMA Specs - Data types `typeof`](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/5.1/#sec-11.4.3)



```js
console.log(typeof null);
```







### Primitive data types are copied by value

Important to remember, all primitive values are passed by value. Meaning when assigning them, the copy of the value is created and assigned to another variable.

```
var myNumber = 10;
var numberCopy = myNumber;  // Number 10 value is copied into another variable

var myName = 'Sarah';
var nameCopy = myName;	// String 'Sarah' is copied into another variable
```





Why did we mention this? Because objects which are non primitives are not being copied. We will talk about them in the upcoming days.
