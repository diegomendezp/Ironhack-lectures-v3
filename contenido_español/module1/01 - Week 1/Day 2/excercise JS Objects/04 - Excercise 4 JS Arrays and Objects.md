## Exercise 4 (Arrays and Objects)
### For these last few challenges, I'll create three penguins for you to work with:
```
var gunter = {
  name: "Gunter",
  origin: "Adventure Time",
  canFly: false,
  sayHello: function () {
    console.log("QUACK!!!");
  }
};

var ramon = {
  name: "Ramón",
  origin: "Happy Feet",
  canFly: true,
  sayHello: function () {
    console.log("Estoy encantado de conocerle.");
  }
};

var fred = {
  name: "Fred",
  origin: "Sitting Ducks",
  canFly: false,
  sayHello: function () {
    console.log("Hi there!");
  }
};
```
---
#### 1. Create a new variable named penguins and set it equal to an array that lists these three penguins! (Hint: remember you can put variable names inside an array, not just hard-coded values! And remember that variable names don't have quotes around them.)

---
#### 2. Access the first penguin in the list and print it to the console using console.log() -- notice that you can see all the properties and methods of that object listed in the console! (Hint: remember that array indexes start counting at 0, not 1!)

---
#### 3. Create a new variable called secondPenguin and set it equal to the second penguin in your penguins array.

---
#### 4. Print to the console the name of the last penguin in the list.

---
#### 5. Remember the penguin you created earlier, with the variable name of myPenguin? Add that penguin to the end of the penguins array!

---
#### 6. Print the length of the penguins array to the console.

---
#### 7. Write one more line of code to change the first penguin's canFly property to the value true (overriding its existing value).

---
#### 8. Call the sayHello method of the first penguin in your penguins array!

---
#### 9. Write a for loop to iterate through every penguin in the array and print the value of each penguin's name property to the console.

---
#### 10. Write a for loop to call the sayHello method of every penguin in the array!

---
#### 11. Write a for loop to iterate through every penguin in the array, and add a new property to each penguin called numberOfFeet with the value 2

---
#### 12. Write another for loop to iterate through every penguin in the array, and for each penguin that can fly, print to the console a message containing the penguin's name and " can fly!" -- for example, "Gunter can fly!" or "Ramón can fly!" (Don't do anything for the penguins that cannot fly.)
