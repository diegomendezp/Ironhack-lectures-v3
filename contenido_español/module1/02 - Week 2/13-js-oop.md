## Learning Objectives

- Combination
- Abstraction
- Encapsulation
- Constructor functions
- methods
- introduction to this
  - `When invoking a method on an object, this becomes the object itself.`
- inheritance concept
- Prototypal inheritance
  - chain of prototypes

- classes in ES6

- The basic idea of OOP is that we use objects to model real world things that we want to represent inside our programs, and/or provide a simple way to access functionality that would otherwise be hard or impossible to make use of.
- Objects can contain related data and code, which represent information about the thing you are trying to model, and functionality or behavior that you want it to have. Object data (and often, functions too) can be stored neatly (the official word is **encapsulated**) inside an object package
